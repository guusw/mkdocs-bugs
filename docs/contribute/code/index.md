# Projects

The Fragcolor ecosystem has a few primary components.

- [Shards](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/shards) open-scripting programming language
- [Hasten](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/hasten) creativity engine (to build apps, games, and open worlds)
- [Clamor](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/clamor) protocol and networking stack

To contribute code to any of the above projects, you will need to [ready your development environment](../getting-started.md). 

Once done, you can check out the guides on [how to build](./build-shards.md) and [run Shards](./run-shards.md).
