# Documenting the API

*Note that as of 2021/10/25, the **API Documentation** for the shards is extracted from the shards binary using the infos-docs.edn script.*

```
./src/build/shards src/tests/infos-docs.edn
```

If you wish to contribute, you can check out our guide on [how to start documenting](./start-documenting.md).
