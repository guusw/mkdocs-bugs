# Start Documenting

## Documentation requirements

At Fragcolor, we use the following to generate and maintain the [documentation website](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/).

- MkDocs & MkDocs Material - Documentation static site generator
- Python - Prerequisite for MkDocs & MkDocs Material
- git & GitHub - Document version control & contribution workflow
- VS Code - Code & document editor

We follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) to standardize our documentation.

## Documentation build environment

### Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system that we can use to track and manage changes to our markdown files.

*Git comes pre-installed on most Mac & Linux machines. If it's not on your machine, you can get the relevant git package [here](https://git-scm.com/download).*

For Windows, download and install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Choose your favorite editor as the default git editor. Git will use this editor when there's a need to resolve merge conflicts.

![Choose default git Editor](assets/install-git_default-editor.png)

Keep the other installation defaults.

You'll can download/ clone the documentation repository via the HTTPS protocol. But you'll need an active [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to fork the documentation repository or contribute to it.

### Python

Python is a pre-requisite for both MkDocs and MkDocs Material.

*Python comes pre-installed on most Mac & Linux machines. If it's not on your machine you can get the relevant Python package [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).*

For windows, you can grab the latest Python release installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Download the installer and follow the on-screen instructions after starting the installation. 

Remember to add Python to Path during the installation.

Disable the Path Length Limit so that your installation can use nested paths.

Keep the other default installation settings.

Type `Python` or `Py` in the terminal to confirm Python installation and version.

=== "Command"

    ```
    Python
    ```

=== "Result"

    ![Python was installed successfully](assets/install-py_installed.png)

Type `where py` in the terminal to see the Python installation path.

=== "Command"

    ```
    where py
    ```

=== "Result"

    ![Show where Python is installed](assets/install-py_where-py.png)

Type `pip` to confirm PIP installation and version.
*PIP is Python Installation Package and installs as part of Python.*

=== "Command"

    ```
    pip
    ```

=== "Result"

    ![Show where Python is installed](assets/install-py_pip-installed.png)

*For more details, refer to the official Python installation [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps).*

### MkDocs

MkDocs allows you to write documentation in markdown and then serve it as a static site. 

Install MkDocs using the `pip` tool.

=== "Command"

    ```
