# Contributing to the wiki

A wiki houses community-contributed knowledge, such as code recipes, etc.

You can access a project's wiki by suffixing '/wiki' to the URL of that project's code repository.

For example, the Shards wiki is at `https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/shards/wiki`.

## Request collaborator access

To edit a project's wiki, you'll need collaborator access to that project's repository. Open an issue in the repository and tag the project maintainer to request this access.

Once you have access, you'll see the **Edit** and **New Page** buttons on the upper right-hand side of the wiki page.

Use the right-hand side **Table Of Contents** to select a page you want to edit.

Click the **Edit** button to start editing the page. You can change the Edit mode by clicking the **Markdown** dropdown.

The **Preview** tab shows you what your formatted document would look like.

Under the **Edit message** field, there's an option to add a commit-message (something that explains your changes).
