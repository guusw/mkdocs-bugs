# Introduction

Shards aims to be a meta language or a visual language rather then a pure programming language. To nicely describe
wires and the data they contain, we adopt a simple language based on EDN and Clojure.

Notice that in theory any language can be used, this was just a pragmatic choice. In fact you will also find wires written in C++ digging the Shards codebase.

One can think of it as a comprehensible JSON on steroids that can be evaluated or the Ansible of general programming.

The execution of Shards scripts is meant to be fast: the scripting language is just a description of the computational graph.
The runtime itself is completely detached.

??? note "Running code samples"
    Many shard code samples (like for the shard [Take](/General/Take)) do not include the wire/mesh context they need to run. To run these samples you need to navigate to `../shards/docs/samples/`and use the following command to provide the necessary boilerplate code to these samples.

    ```
        cd docs/samples
        ../../build/shards.exe run-sample.edn --file "<relative-path-of-sample.edn>"
    ```

## Some examples

### Super simple example

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    ; define a mesh
    (defmesh main)
    ; define a simple hello world looped wire
    (defloop hello-world
      (Msg "Hello world"))
    ; schedule the wire for exection
    (schedule main hello-world)
    ; run the mesh at 1 second intervals
    (run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:22.290] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:23.299] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:24.291] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:25.289] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:26.291] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:27.299] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:28.296] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:29.292] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:30.295] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:31.298] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    [info] [2021-04-04 16:43:32.298] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
    ```

### Another example

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    ; define a mesh
    (defmesh main)
    ; define a simple counter looped wire
    (defloop counter
    ; Setup runs only once at wire start
    (Setup
    0 >= .counter)
    ; get counter variable and print
    .counter (Log)
    ; increase the counter
    (Math.Inc .counter)
    ; notice that Math.Inc will passthrough the value
    ; so the value will be before increment
    ; if we wanted to pick up the increment uncomment the next line
    ; .counter
    (When (Is 10) (Stop)))
    ; schedule the wire for exection
    (schedule main counter)
    ; run the mesh at 1 second intervals
    (run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:43.045] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 0
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:44.055] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 1
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:45.058] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 2
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:46.057] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 3
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:47.049] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 4
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:48.057] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 5
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:49.046] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 6
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:50.049] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 7
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:51.058] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 8
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:52.054] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 9
    [info] [2021-04-04 19:00:53.055] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 10
    ```

### A more complex example

Showing how we mix the Clojure-like language as a template language

=== "Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    ; define a mesh
    (defmesh main)
    ; define a counter template
    (defn make-counter [start]
    ; this time we use the Wire symbol as we want to make a function
    (Wire
    ; customize the wire's name
    (str "counter-" start) :Looped
    ; Setup runs only once at wire start
    (Setup
        ; set start with the start function argument
        start >= .counter)
    ; get counter variable and print
    .counter (Log)
    ; increase the counter
    (Math.Inc .counter)
    ; notice that Math.Inc will passthrough the value
    ; so the value will be before increment
    ; if we wanted to pick up the increment uncomment the next line
    ; .counter
    ; also at wire definition time compute the end value
    ; (+) is not a shard, it will be evaluated only once when composing the wire
    (When (Is (+ start 10)) (Stop))))
    ; schedule 2 wires for exection
    (schedule main (make-counter 0))
    (schedule main (make-counter 10))
    ; run the mesh at 1 second intervals
    (run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
    ```
